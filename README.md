# CityBuddy

CityBuddy is a web application that helps users discover interesting places to visit in different cities around the world. It provides information about popular tourist attractions, local restaurants, and events happening in the city.

## Design Process

CityBuddy was created as a UX project in university. We used Figma to design the user interface and create prototypes. Our design process included the following steps:

**Research**: We conducted user research to understand the needs and preferences of our target audience. We also researched similar applications to identify best practices.
**Wireframing**: We created low-fidelity wireframes to map out the basic structure and flow of the application.
**Prototyping**: We used Figma to create high-fidelity prototypes with interactive features. We tested these prototypes with users to gather feedback and make improvements.
**Visual Design**: We created a visual design for the application that reflects its fun and playful nature.
