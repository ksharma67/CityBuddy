## Folder Structure

### PDPE1 - Personas + Jobs to be done

This folder contains the personas and jobs to be done that were created during the initial stages of the project. Personas are fictional representations of different user types, and jobs to be done are the specific tasks that users are trying to accomplish. These personas and jobs to be done helped to guide the design and development of the application.

### PDPE2 - Paper Prototype

This folder contains the paper prototype that was created during the early stages of the project. The paper prototype is a low-fidelity version of the application that is used to test different design concepts and user flows. The feedback received from testing the paper prototype is used to iterate on the design of the application.

### PDPE3 - Research Proposal

This folder contains the research proposal that outlines the research methodology and objectives of the project. The proposal included information about the research questions that the team investigated, the data collection methods that were used, and the expected outcomes of the research.

### PDPE4 - Research Questions

This folder contains the specific research questions that the team will be investigating during the project. These questions were designed to help the team understand how users interacted with the application and what improvements could be made to enhance the user experience.

### City Buddy.fig

This file contains various design iterations created during the prototyping phase of the project, ranging from low-fidelity paper prototypes to high-fidelity digital prototypes.
